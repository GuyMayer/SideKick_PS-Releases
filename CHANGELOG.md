# SideKick_PS Changelog

## Requires AutoHotkey v1.1+
<!--
AI INSTRUCTIONS - When publishing a new version:
1. Update this CHANGELOG.md with the new version entry
2. Update version.json in this repo with:
   - "version": new version number
   - "build_date": current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - "release_notes": brief summary
   - "changelog": array of changes (NEW/FIX/IMPROVED prefixes)
3. Commit and push both files to Git
4. Run the build script to compile and create installer

NOTE: SideKick_PS now includes SideKick_GC (GoCardless) as a unified package.
SideKick_GC changes are tracked here alongside SideKick_PS from v2.5.53 onward.
SideKick_GC can also run independently — its own CHANGELOG.md covers standalone releases.

## v3.1.2 (2026-09-08) — Self-healing GHL credentials + single Gist upload path

### Fixed

- **Stale API key shadowing.** A `credentials.json` saved next to the app
  could shadow the key saved in Settings (`%APPDATA%`), so GHL kept reporting
  "API Key Invalid" even after a fresh key was pasted. Settings now wins, and
  the stale install-folder copy is archived automatically (`.stale-<timestamp>`).
- **Log upload 401.** "Send Logs" failed with "Upload Failed - 401 Bad
  credentials" because the app embedded a second Gist token that GitHub had
  revoked. All uploads now go through the SideKick CLI's verified token — one
  token, one code path (`sync-invoice --upload-logs`).

### Improved

- **Rejected-key fingerprint.** When the GHL permission test rejects a key,
  the popup now shows the rejected key's fingerprint (`pit-...XXXX`), making a
  stale key instantly recognisable.
- **Build guard.** The build aborts automatically if GitHub has revoked the
  log-upload token.

## v3.0.34 (2026-09-05) — Invoice sync silent-failure fix

### Fixed

- **Invoice sync no longer reports success when no GHL invoice is created.**
  `create_ghl_invoice()` returned `None` for orders with no payment lines, no
  product items, or no invoice items, and HTTP/network errors were recorded
  but never flipped the overall success flag — so the toolbar showed
  "Sync Complete" with no invoice behind it. All three skip cases now return
  an explicit failure dict, and `_process_sync` propagates any invoice failure
  into the overall result, showing "Sync Failed" with the reason.

## v3.0.33 (2026-09-04) — Lead Flow mirror (Phase A) + credential fix

### Improvements

- **New "Lead Flow" tab in Settings** for mirroring invoice syncs to a
  second, separate GHL account (Lead Flow). Holds the secondary Location ID,
  API key (stored in `credentials.json` alongside the primary key), a
  **Test** button that distinguishes an invalid key (401) from a key without
  access to the location (403), a mirror-tag selector fed from the master
  GHL tag list, and two toggles: **Enable mirror** and **Totals only**
  (off = detailed product lines from ProSelect; on = single sale + payment
  totals).
- **Mirror tag filter wired into the sync flow.** After a successful invoice
  sync, SideKick checks the master-GHL contact for the configured mirror tag
  and logs the Lead Flow mirror outcome. The mirror write itself lands in
  Phase B (pending the Lead Flow account API key).
- **"Lead Flow ID" contact custom field** created in the master GHL location
  and registered in the sync config. It will hold the Lead Flow
  location/contact ID and doubles as the "is a Lead Flow client" flag.
- **Lead Flow ID field selector.** The Lead Flow tab has a dropdown listing
  the master GHL contact custom fields (with a refresh button), so the field
  used to store the Lead Flow ID is user-selectable instead of hard-coded.
  The chosen field name is saved to `[GHL] LeadFlowIDField` and resolved to
  its field ID at sync time (falling back to the default field).
- **Credentials writer hardened.** Settings save now writes the full
  credential set (GoCardless token, Cardly fields, Gist token, secondary
  key/location) instead of truncating `credentials.json`.

## v3.0.32 (2026-08-28) — GoCardless token fix

### Fixed

- **GoCardless API token no longer appears missing after an update.** The
  credential lookup was preferring an empty `%APPDATA%\SideKick_GC\credentials.json`
  over the legacy `%APPDATA%\SideKick_PS\credentials.json` where existing users'
  tokens live. `load_config` now falls back to the legacy stores when the primary
  store has no token, so the token is found again without re-entry.

- **Payments now appear in the album after clicking "Schedule Payments".** The
  ProSelect payment dialog is now closed before the album reload, so the reload
  no longer fails with "Application Busy" and the new payment lines show up.

## v3.0.31 (2026-08-28) — Update channel moved to public releases repo

### Fixed

- **Downloads and auto-updates restored after the source repo went private.**
  The git-leak remediation made `GuyMayer/SideKick_PS` private, which broke the
  public release URLs (404). The release channel now lives in a public
  `GuyMayer/SideKick_PS-Releases` repo holding only `version.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
  and the installer asset. Auto-updater, downloader, and all fallback links point
  at the public repo. Source repo stays private.

## Unreleased (2026-08-23) — PSA payment-line date ordering

### Improvements

- **`write_psa_payments.py` always date-orders the payments block**: every
  write pass re-sorts ALL payment lines in the target order group by date
  (earliest first) — entering an earlier-dated payment later no longer needs
  manual delete/reorder in ProSelect. Backs the album up (`.bak`) before
  writing and aborts if the line count changes during the sort.

## Unreleased (2026-08-18) — DSA audit refactor wave

Twelve findings from the automated DSA audit (2026-08-18), implemented
test-first with per-fix commits (`ee88587`…`fc589a5`). Mostly internal
restructuring; several latent bugs fixed along the way.

### Refactoring

- **Settings schema (F1)**: `LoadSettings`/`SaveSettings` now iterate a
  declarative schema (`Inc_SettingsSchema.ahk`) instead of hand-paired
  IniRead/IniWrite lists — load/save can no longer drift apart.
- **Opportunity order fields (F2)**: `_build_opportunity_order_fields()`
  replaces the duplicated payment-summary + product-text logic in the two
  opportunity sync paths.
- **Unified INI loader (F3)**: single cached `_load_ini_config()`; all four
  config readers now resolve the same INI file.
- **PSA thumbnail loading (F4)**: shared `_parse_psa_image_list`,
  `_build_psa_source_paths`, `_extract_psa_thumbs` helpers in
  `cardly_preview_gui.py`; each load mode is now a thin wrapper.
- **Cardly recipient model (F5)**: one canonical internal recipient schema +
  `to_cardly_recipient()` translation, used by both send paths.
- **GHL stage vocabulary (F6)**: stage and hold-reason strings imported as
  constants instead of hardcoded variants.
- **Shared `psa_order` module (F7)**: OrderList read/decode + client/payment
  field parsing centralized; five CLI scripts rewired with byte-identical
  golden output.
- **Build cache removal (F8)**: `$ForceRebuild` defaulted to `$true`, making
  the whole cache layer unreachable — removed.
- **Version single source (F9)**: `build_and_archive.ps1` reads `version.json`
  when `-Version` is omitted and syncs it when given; `run_build.bat` no
  longer hardcodes the version.
- **Shared `ghl_media` module (F10)**: folder lookup/create + upload in one
  module; `upload_file` now resolves `folder_name` to `parentId`.
- **PaymentBlockEditor (F11)**: payment-block locate/create/insert/attribute
  updates encapsulated; behavior pinned by byte-exact tests.
- **Toolbar button registry (F12)**: `Inc_ToolbarButtons.ahk` is the single
  source for button visibility/count/sections in `CreateFloatingToolbar`.

### Bug Fixes found during the refactor

- **Cardly addresses were never sanitised**: `sanitize_recipient` checked
  internal keys (`address1`, `state`) after the dict was already translated
  to Cardly keys (`address`, `region`) — streets and regions shipped
  un-title-cased. Sanitisation now runs before translation (F5).
- **Supplier sync set an invalid GHL stage**: `"Ready To Collect"` vs the
  live pipeline's `"Ready for Collection"`, and hold-reason casing mismatched
  the defined option (F6).
- **App version showed "Unknown" in Python tools**: `version.json` had a
  UTF-8 BOM and trailing JSON garbage, breaking `json.load` in
  `sync_ps_invoice.py` (F9).
- **`upload_file(folder_name=…)` silently ignored its folder** (F10).
- **Toolbar width estimate drifted**: the count included LightBlue when not
  installed and omitted the Production button entirely (F12).
- **PSA "all thumbnails" mode crashed** on a missing local `sqlite3` import
  and silently fell back to folder scanning (F4).
- **License validation ran on every launch**: `Updates/LastCheckDate` was
  saved but never loaded, resetting the 7-day gate (F1).

## v3.0.30 (2026-08-03)

### Bug Fixes (v3.0.30)

- **Phone number format causing GHL invoice 422 rejection**: Local-format phone
  numbers (e.g. UK `07948…`, US `212-555…`) were sent raw to the GHL invoice API
  which requires E.164 format (`+447948…`). GHL returned 422 and the invoice was
  silently not created. Fixed: phone numbers are now normalised to E.164 before
  being sent. Strips spaces, dashes, dots, and parentheses; converts `00` prefix
  to `+`; prefixes local numbers with the country dialling code.
- **Country code auto-detected from Windows locale**: No configuration needed.
  The Windows `GetUserGeoID` / `GetGeoInfoW` API returns the user's country
  (e.g. `GB`, `US`) which is mapped to its ITU-T dialling code (`+44`, `+1`).
  Override with `[Settings] PhoneCountryCode=+1` in `SideKick_PS.ini` if needed.
  Numbers already in E.164 format pass through unchanged.

---

## v3.0.29 (2026-08-01)

### Bug Fixes (v3.0.29)

- **GHL invoice not created for phone-only contacts**: Contacts without an email
  address were silently blocked from having a GHL invoice created. The email field
  is optional in the GHL API — only `id`, `name` and optionally `phoneNo` are
  required. Fixed: email absence is now logged as info and the invoice proceeds.
  `email` is conditionally included in the payload only when present.
- **Webhook not firing on re-syncs / order updates**: The `--update-invoice` code
  path had no webhook call, so clients whose orders were updated (rather than
  created fresh) never triggered a webhook POST. Fixed: webhook now fires on
  successful invoice updates using the same guards as the new-sync path.

---

## v3.0.27 (2026-07-29)

### Improved (v3.0.27)

- **Order Webhook diagnostics**: When **Debug Logging** is enabled, the order sync webhook now logs full request and response detail to the standard `sync_debug_*.log` file (same file that gets auto-uploaded to Gist when **Auto-send activity logs** is on). Captures per attempt:
  - Request: URL, method, contact ID, order ID, total, currency, GHL invoice/opportunity IDs, item count, auth header presence, full JSON payload
  - Response (success or error): HTTP status code, reason phrase, elapsed ms, response URL, body (up to 2000 chars), Content-Type, Server, Content-Length
  - Timeouts, connection errors, and unhandled exceptions logged with error type, message, and traceback
  - Gated by the existing `DebugLogging` INI setting — nothing logged when debug mode is off
- **Order Webhook error visibility**: When the webhook receiver returns a 4xx or 5xx HTTP response, SideKick now prints three info-only `[WEBHOOK] ⚠` lines to stdout (visible in the sync progress window):
  - Status code + reason + elapsed time (e.g. `⚠ Server returned 500 Internal Server Error (245ms)`)
  - First line of the server's error message body (up to 120 chars)
  - Reassurance that the GHL invoice sync succeeded and only the webhook receiver failed (non-blocking)
  - Does not interrupt the workflow — no modal dialog, no dismissal required

---

## v3.0.26 (2026-07-28)

### New (v3.0.26)

- **Order Sync Webhook (universal)**: SideKick_PS can now fire a fire-and-forget HTTP POST to a configurable webhook URL after every successful ProSelect invoice sync to GHL. The payload includes contact ID, order ID (`PS-{shoot_no}`), order total, currency, line items, and the GHL invoice/opportunity IDs. Configurable in **Settings → GHL Integration → Order Sync Webhook**. Leave blank to disable (default).
  - Designed for pushing orders into QuickBooks, Zapier, Make, n8n, or any custom receiver.
  - Fires on both single-order syncs and batch month-sync runs (0.5s spacing between POSTs in batch mode to protect downstream API rate limits).
  - Skips no-sale orders (£0 total) so they don't generate empty invoices downstream.
  - Receiver deduplication by `orderId` is assumed — safe to retry.
  - Failures never block the sync; warnings print to console and debug log only.
  - Currency auto-read from `[GoCardless] Currency` (default `GBP`).
  - Optional `[GHL] OrderSyncAuthToken` for receivers requiring `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

### Improved (v3.0.26)

- **Payment Calculator duration presets**: Added **6**, **12**, **18**, and
  **24** buttons under **No. Payments**. Each button fills the payment count
  for that duration using the selected recurrence (Monthly, Weekly, Bi-Weekly,
  or 4-Weekly), then recalculates the instalment amount.
- **Schedule Payments progress overlay**: Clicking "✓ Schedule Payments" now
  shows a dark progress popup ("Scheduling payments…") and disables all action
  buttons to prevent accidental double-clicks during PSA writes + script
  reload. Buttons re-enable automatically on validation errors so the user can
  correct and retry.
- **Settings GUI 20% taller**: Window grew from `h750` to `h900` to give the GHL Integration tab room to breathe and accommodate the new webhook field without crowding. All five content panels (General, GHL, Hotkeys, File Management, License) scaled to match. Sidebar, content background, and bottom button bar all repositioned cleanly.

---

## v3.0.23 (2026-07-21)

### New (v3.0.23)

- **GoCardless stale-date recovery option - Start From Next Available Date**: When a plan is created late and original dates are now stale, the dialog now offers a new option to start from the next GoCardless-valid date and shift the full schedule forward together.

### Bug Fixes (v3.0.23)

- **Stale-date replay only deferred by one month**: The stale-date flow previously hard-coded `--bump-months 1`. It now computes the minimum whole-month shift needed from the original first payment date to reach the GoCardless lead-time cutoff before replaying the schedule.
- **GoCardless-adjusted paylines not persisted to SideKick payment state**: After a stale-date adjustment, the in-memory/INI payment lines could remain out of sync with the newly created GoCardless schedule. The flow now updates `[PaymentLines] PaymentLine.N` and matching `[Payments]` keys so save/update/load routines use the adjusted dates consistently.

---

## v3.0.22 (2026-06-20)

### New (v3.0.22)

- **Multi-order support — Order Picker dialog**: Albums with more than one order group now show a `DarkOrderPicker` dropdown listing all orders (e.g. `Order 1 — Sonia Field (£540.00)`) and defaulting to the latest order. Replaces the previous multi-button `DarkMsgBox` pattern. Applies to both the GoCardless and Invoice toolbar flows.
- **Order totals in picker**: `detect_psa_group.py` AMBIGUOUS output now includes the order balance as a third field per group (`id|name|total`). The picker label and the PayPlan Calculator hotkey button both display `(£XXX.XX)` alongside the order name.

### Bug Fixes (v3.0.22)

- **GoCardless mandate lookup pagination**: `_find_customer_by_email()` and `_find_customers_by_name()` now cursor-paginate through all customers. Previously only the first 50 results were searched, causing "mandate not found" for customers beyond page 1. The `email=` and `per_page=` query params are both rejected by this GoCardless account and have been removed.
- **Replace PayPlan guard**: When the user selects any order beyond Order 1 in the GoCardless flow, `Replace PayPlan` is automatically overridden to `Add PayPlan` to prevent cancelling the shared mandate's existing plan.

### Improved (v3.0.22)

- **Mandate Active dialog — payment progress**: Plan info now shows `6/6 complete` or `3/6 paid` instead of just the plan name and amount, giving a clearer picture of payment status without opening the GoCardless dashboard.

---

## v3.0.21 (2026-05-29)

### Bug Fixes (v3.0.21)

- **GC interval detection**: `_infer_interval_days()` tolerance tightened from `<= 3` to `<= 1`. Monthly payment gaps of 30–31 days no longer falsely match as 28-day (4-weekly), preventing GoCardless schedules from drifting off the chosen day-of-month.
- **GC stray one-off payment**: Removed amount check from `needs_split` logic. Rounding-adjusted first payments (e.g. £180.72 vs £180.58) no longer trigger a split into a standalone one-off + truncated schedule.
- **GC stale date false positive**: `_paylines_need_bump()` changed `<=` to `<`. Payment dates exactly 4 calendar days away (the minimum GC allows) are no longer flagged as stale.
- **Existing PayPlan detection**: Now only counts GoCardless DD payments when checking for an existing plan — credit card deposits and other methods no longer trigger the Replace/Add dialog.

### New (v3.0.21)

- **PSA pay period metadata**: `write_psa_payments.py` now writes the Payment Calculator's Recurring selection (`--meta recurring:Monthly`) and chosen day (`--meta pay_day:28th`) to `sk_ps_meta` table in the PSA. Enables forensic audit of intent vs actual dates.
- **Pay 1st ASAP option**: When GC dates are stale, a new button splits the first payment as a one-off (GC picks earliest valid date) and creates an instalment schedule for the rest on their original dates. Added `--split-first-asap` CLI arg and `_GetEarliestGCDate()` helper.
- **`_GetEarliestGCDate()`**: Returns today + 4 days in dd/MM/yyyy format for display in stale-date dialog.

### Improved (v3.0.21)

- Meta values space-sanitised (spaces → hyphens) to survive shell argument splitting during PSA writes.

---

## v3.0.20 (2026-04-25)

### Bug Fixes (v3.0.20)

- **Supplier status SSH query fix**: Remote DB query now passes the Python script via stdin (`python3 -`) instead of `python3 -c`, fixing a Windows SSH issue where multi-line scripts were broken into separate shell commands and failed silently.
- **openclaw backfill pagination**: `backfill.js` `searchMessagesKQL()` was hard-capped at 25 results per folder due to `Math.min(top, 25)`. Now paginates using a `from` offset loop, fetching up to 200 emails per folder (300 total found vs 150 before).
- **openclaw Loxley multi-shoot parsing**: `parser.js` now matches bare shoot numbers (`P26028P`) and name-only refs from multi-shoot order emails like `P26024p - P26025p - P26028P`. Previously only matched the `P26028P_LastName` format, causing multi-shoot orders to produce garbage job_refs.
- **Supplier DB cleanup**: Removed garbage records with non-shoot job_refs (e.g. `"order value"`, `"Order Reference"`) left by the previous broken parser.

---

## v3.0.19 (2026-04-25)

### New Features (v3.0.19)

- **GHL Client Lookup — PSA file fallback**: When the open ProSelect album has no GHL client ID in its name, the lookup now reads the `.psa` file to extract the client's first name, last name, shoot number, and email. It searches GHL by email first, then shoot number, then full name before falling back to the Chrome scan dialog.
- **GHL Client Lookup — title fallback**: If the PSA file cannot be read, the shoot number and last name are parsed directly from the ProSelect window title (e.g. `P25097P_Field`) and used for GHL search.
- **Check Shoot Status — auto GHL lookup**: If the open album has no GHL client ID in its name, Check Shoot Status now automatically triggers the GHL Client Lookup flow first, then continues with the status check.
- **Check Shoot Status — simplified job ref derivation**: Job ref is now derived purely from the (possibly just-updated) ProSelect window title, removing the redundant PSA filename parse.
- **Check Shoot Status icon**: Updated to a clipboard-check icon across all three icon fonts (Phosphor / Font Awesome / Segoe) to better represent quality control.

---

## v3.0.18 (2026-04-24)

### New Features (v3.0.18)

- **Force re-evaluate opportunity stage** (Batch Actions): New checkbox passes `--batch-force-opp-stage` to the Python sync. When ticked, already-synced shoots (those with PSA sync metadata) are no longer skipped for the opportunity move — their stage is re-evaluated from the archive and updated in GHL. Invoice creation is still skipped for those shoots.
- **No Sale pipeline stage routing**: Shoots where the ProSelect order total is £0 are now automatically routed to the `No Sale` stage in the Boudoir Production Pipeline instead of `New Order`. Applies to both new opportunity creation and moves of existing opportunities. Genuine no-sales (client attended, bought nothing) stay in No Sale on subsequent syncs.

### Fixes (v3.0.18)

- **Duplicate invoice dialog showed amount ÷ 100**: `check_existing_invoice` was dividing GHL invoice totals by 100 when `> 1000`, based on a stale assumption that the API returned pence. GHL invoice API returns pounds — division removed from `total`, `amount_due`, `amount_paid`, `amountPaid` (update path), and `amountDue` (final state re-fetch).
- **DateTime pickers not hidden on tab switch**: `GenBatchMonthFrom`, `GenBatchMonthTo`, `GenBatchFromLabel`, and `GenBatchToLabel` were missing from `ShowSettingsTab`'s hide/show lists (replaced the old stale `GenBatchMonthLabel` / `GenBatchMonthPicker` references). Pickers now correctly hide when switching away from the General tab.
- **Stage name Compleate → Complete**: Renamed `PRODUCTION_COMPLETE_STAGE` constant to `'Complete'`. Alias list updated to accept both `'compleate'` and `'complete'` so older PSA archive folders with the old spelling still resolve correctly.
- **No Sale routing used wrong signal**: The initial implementation routed to No Sale when `payments_count == 0` (no payment transaction records), which incorrectly caught clients with a real order value but no payment entered yet. Changed to `order_total <= 0` — only genuine £0 orders go to No Sale.

---

## v3.0.17 (2026-04-22)

### New Features (v3.0.17)

- **Batch sync date range** (Settings → General → Batch Actions): The single "Month to process" picker has been replaced with a **From / To** pair. Selecting a range (e.g. January–March) chains one generate-XML + one Python sync call per month using `&&`, so any month failure halts the rest. Single-month behaviour is identical to before. The chosen range is persisted to `[Batch] MonthDateTo` in the INI file and validated on launch (From > To shows an error).

### Fixes (v3.0.17)

- **GHL invoice 400 when discount exceeds items total**: If a ProSelect order contains a discount or credit that is larger than the sum of all line items (e.g. a standalone £200 voucher with £0 product lines), GHL rejected the invoice payload with *"Invoice total amount must be greater than or equal to 0"*. The discount is now capped to the items total before being sent; a `[WARN]` line is written to the sync log when capping occurs. Applied to both the create and update invoice paths in `sync_ps_invoice.py`.
- **GHL opportunity tags 422 — missing required fields**: The PUT `/opportunities/{id}` payload was built with only `tags` and `monetaryValue`, omitting `name` and `status` which the GHL v2 API treats as required. The call returned 422 with a response body that was not visible in logs. Fixed: `name` is now always included (fallback chain: `name` → `title` → `"Opportunity {id}"`), `status` defaults to `open` if absent, and the 422 response body is now written to the error log file.

---

## v3.0.16 (2026-04-18)

### Fixes (v3.0.16)

- **GHL contact/opp tag refresh overwrites unsaved selection**: Clicking 🔄 in the Settings GHL tab to refresh tags from GHL was silently reverting the ComboBox back to the previously-saved INI value. All four refresh handlers (`RefreshGHLTags`, `RefreshGHLTagsSilent`, `RefreshGHLOppTags`, `RefreshGHLOppTagsSilent`) were reading `Settings_GHLTags` / `Settings_GHLOppTags` globals instead of the live ComboBox state, so whatever tag the user had just selected was lost. Fixed by using `GuiControlGet` to read the current ComboBox value before rebuilding the list.

---

## v3.0.15 (2026-04-17)

### Fixes (v3.0.15)

- **GHL invoice unit-price double-multiplication**: `Extended_Price` in the ProSelect XML is a line total (unit × qty). The code was passing it directly to GHL as the unit `amount` field, so GHL multiplied by qty a second time — e.g. qty 21 × £2,310 = £48,510 instead of £2,310. Fixed by dividing back to the true unit price before building the GHL line item.
- **LB icon visible on wrong settings tab**: The Light Blue icon and label in the Toolbar Shortcuts settings panel were missing from both the hide-all sweep and the Shortcuts show block in `ShowSettingsTab`, causing them to remain visible after switching to any other tab.

### New Features (v3.0.15)

- **Skip £0 paired extras toggle** (Settings → GHL): New toggle (default ON) that removes zero-price accessory lines (mats, frames, etc.) from GHL invoices when they share the same ProSelect Item ID as a priced parent line. Standalone £0 items are kept. Applies to new invoice, replace, and update flows.
- **LB toolbar button hidden when LightBlue is not installed**: At startup SideKick_PS now detects whether LightBlue is installed (installed exe or sibling dev path). If not found, the LB toolbar button is not created and the LB row is hidden in the Toolbar Shortcuts settings tab.

---

## v3.0.14 (2026-04-16)

### Fixes (v3.0.14)

- **Menu delay minimum raised to 150ms**: The startup CPU benchmark previously set delays as low as 50ms on fast PCs, which caused toolbar button keystrokes to occasionally miss on fast machines. The calibrated minimum is now 150ms; slow PCs continue to use 200ms. The settings panel colour thresholds and tooltip text have been updated to match.
- **Sort button initial state reflects randomised album**: The sort toggle previously initialised as 🔀 (click to randomise), implying the album was in filename order. Because albums are randomised automatically after loading, the button now initialises as 🔤 (click to sort by filename), accurately reflecting the current state from the start of every session.

### Changed (v3.0.14)

- **Schedule Payments no longer triggers GoCardless setup**: After injecting payment lines into the album, the payment calculator no longer attempts to look up a mandate or create a GoCardless plan automatically. The success dialog now prompts the user to click the **GoCardless toolbar button** to set up the Direct Debit, keeping the two workflows clearly separate.

---

## v3.0.12 (2026-03-24)

### Fixes (v3.0.12)

- **Replace PayPlan not cancelling old plan**: When the user clicked "Replace PayPlan", the `--cancel-plans` command ran but on `ERROR|` the code only showed a warning and continued to create the new plan — leaving both the old plan (e.g. Mirror) and the new one active on GoCardless. All four cancel-then-create paths (`Toolbar_GoCardless`, name-fallback, `GC_SearchMandate` in `SideKick_PS.ahk`, and `UpdatePS` in `Inc_Hotkeys.ahk`) now `return` immediately on cancel failure and also verify the result is `SUCCESS|` before proceeding.

---

## v3.0.11 (2026-03-24)

### Fixes (v3.0.11)

- **Sale completion GoCardless prompt "Could not find client email"**: The `UpdatePS` label's GoCardless section only checked two sources for the client email — the `GHL_ContactData` cache and `getAlbumData` XML email attribute — both of which can be empty when the album was opened without a prior GHL fetch. Now uses the same robust 3-tier fallback as `Toolbar_GoCardless:`: window title parsing for GHL contact ID (15+ alphanumeric segments) → PSA filename fallback via `SplitPath` on `GetAlbumPath()` → PSA SQLite `clientCode` and email fields → `FetchGHLData()` by discovered ID. The resolved `GHL_ContactData` is also cached so the subsequent `GC_ShowPayPlanDialog` call inherits it.
- **GoCardless pay plan creation duplicated paylines**: `GC_ShowPayPlanDialog` built the `--clear-method` argument using `resultMethod` before that variable was assigned — it was only assigned 6 lines later. The empty `--clear-method ""` meant `write_psa_payments.py` never cleared existing GoCardless DD entries before writing the new ones, producing exact duplicates. Fixed by moving the `resultMethod` extraction (from the result JSON `"method"` field, with `ddPayMethod` fallback) above the `writeArgs` line where it is consumed.
- **GoCardless `--clear-method` removing collected GoCardless deposits**: `--clear-method` matched by method name only, so a GoCardless DD deposit that was already collected (e.g. an upfront GoCardless payment recorded as "GoCardless DD" in the album) was treated the same as a future scheduled instalment and removed. The clearing logic now also checks each matching payment's `jdate`: entries with a **past or today** date are preserved (already collected); only entries with a **strictly future** date (upcoming DD plan instalments) are removed. Re-applying a plan never touches any payment that has already been processed.
- **GoCardless `--clear-method ""` wiping all payments when method is empty**: Python's `"" in "Credit Card"` evaluates to `True`, so an empty `--clear-method` argument would match and delete every payment in the album — including any Cash or Credit Card deposit. Added a guard in `write_psa_payments.py`: if the method string is blank after stripping, clearing is skipped entirely and all existing payments are left intact.

---

## v3.0.10 (2026-03-23)

### Fixes (v3.0.10)

- **GoCardless payment injection erasing deposit**: `write_psa_payments.py` was called with `--clear` which blanket-deleted all payments in the album group before injecting the GoCardless instalment schedule. Because SideKick_GC only returns DD instalment lines (not the original deposit), today's cash/card downpayment was silently removed every time a pay plan was set up. Fixed by replacing `--clear` with `--clear-method "GoCardless DD"` — only existing GoCardless DD entries are removed; all other payment methods (cash, card, etc.) are preserved.

---

## v3.0.9 (2026-03-19)

### Fixes (v3.0.9)

- **GoCardless / Cardly "No Client Found" when Mirror window is active**: `WinGetTitle, psTitle, ahk_exe ProSelect.exe` can return a ProSelect sub-window title (e.g. "Mirror") instead of the main album window title when that sub-window has focus. The regex extraction then finds no `_ID` segment and the contact-ID lookup fails entirely. Fixed by adding a fast PSA-filename extraction step (via `SplitPath` on the `GetAlbumPath()` result) as the primary fallback in both `Toolbar_GoCardless:` and `Toolbar_Cardly:` — the PSA filename already contains the GHL ID and does not depend on the ProSelect window title at all. The slow SQLite `<clientCode>` lookup is retained as a final fallback. Cardly now also logs `albumContactId from psaPath` to the debug log.

---

## v3.0.8 (2026-03-13)

### Fixes (v3.0.8)

- **Cardly PSA path resolved too late**: `psaPath` was only initialised in the image-folder block, but the client ID SQLite fallback (which runs earlier) had always checked `psaPath != ""` — that condition was never true, so albums without a GHL ID in their filename could never have their contact resolved from the PSA. `GetAlbumPath()` via PSConsole is now called before both the `albumContactId` block and the image-folder block
- **Cardly image folder \u2014 PSConsole promoted to primary source**: ProSelect's window title contains only a filename, not a full path, so `psaPath := albumMatch1` then `FileExist()` immediately failed. PSConsole `getAlbumData` is now the primary source; title parsing is kept as a fallback only
- **Cardly folder-browse default folder**: When no image folder is auto-detected the `FileSelectFolder` dialog now opens pre-navigated to the album directory (derived from PSA path or PSConsole) rather than the system root

### New Features (v3.0.8)

- **Cardly diagnostic logging**: Every Cardly button press now writes a structured trace to the SideKick debug log — ProSelect title, `GetAlbumPath()` result, `albumContactId`, `orderExportsDir`, shoot number, GHL ID, resolved `imageFolder`, and `noAlbumMode` flag

---

## v3.0.7 (2026-03-13)

### Fixes (v3.0.7)

- **GoCardless stale client data**: `Toolbar_GoCardless:` was reusing `GHL_ContactData` from a previous album session without checking whether it matched the current album — if you clicked the GoCardless button after switching clients, it either used the wrong mandate or threw "No Client Found". Now always resolves the client ID from the album title / PSA file first, and re-fetches from GHL if the cached contact doesn't match (mirrors the existing Cardly / print path behaviour)
- **GoCardless duplicate payment on delayed submission**: When a payment plan was set up in ProSelect but GoCardless submission was delayed by several days, the instalment schedule dates could fall inside the BACS lead-time window, causing a double-charge on the nearest valid date. The CLI now detects stale dates before creating any plan and emits `DATES_STALE` so SideKick_PS can offer the user a one-month date bump — same amounts, same day-of-month, just one month later (preserving client affordability)
- **`--bump-months N` CLI flag (SideKick_GC v1.2.2)**: After user confirms the date bump, SideKick_PS re-submits with shifted paylines and `--bump-months 1` to bypass the stale-date check on the retry

---

## v3.0.6 (2026-03-12)

### Fixes (v3.0.6)

- **Print-to-PDF printer not switching**: `Control, Choose` only updated the visual selection in the print dialog's printer list — replaced with `ControlSend {Home}/{Down}` keyboard navigation which triggers the dialog's internal WM_NOTIFY so the printer actually changes
- **PDF button printing to paper**: Caused by the above — printer was not switching to "Microsoft Print to PDF" before clicking Print
- **Print button wrong target**: `ControlClick, Button1` was hitting "Preferences" instead of Print — replaced with a loop that reads each button's text via `ControlGetText` and clicks the exact button labelled "&Print"
- **Save As filename wrong**: `SplitPath` was going up two levels from the album folder, picking up a year/date folder name — fixed to use the album folder name directly, with a known-subfolder guard for "Unprocessed" etc.
- **Save As text field not populating**: `ControlSetText` is unreliable in Windows file dialogs — switched to clipboard paste (`Ctrl+A`, `Ctrl+V`)
- **PDF email wrong template used**: `Settings_PDFEmailTemplateID` was unconditionally cleared to `""` in both Settings Apply handlers before re-matching against the cache — if the template cache was empty that session the ID was lost, causing the wrong (or no) template to be sent. Now only re-looked up when the cache is populated; existing saved ID is preserved otherwise

---

## v3.0.5 (2026-03-12)

### New Features (v3.0.5)

- **Selection-first image loading (Cardly)**: When images are selected in ProSelect, the Cardly preview loads only those selected images instead of the full album — significantly faster startup
- **Duplicate card warning (Cardly)**: Clicking Send now checks for cards sent to the same recipient in the last 7 days and shows a confirmation dialog with order details and a link to the Cardly orders page
- **GHL note on card send (Cardly)**: A note is automatically added to the GHL contact after a card is successfully sent, including the recipient name and message body

### Fixes (v3.0.5)

- **False "card sent" toast (Cardly)**: Cancelling the Cardly preview no longer shows a "card sent" system notification — replaced unreliable AHK exit code check with a signal file approach

---

## v3.0.4 (2026-03-11)

### New Features (v3.0.4)

- **Auto name-fallback for GoCardless**: When the client's email doesn't match a GoCardless customer, SideKick automatically retries by name. If a mandate is found under a different email, a "Same Client?" confirmation dialog shows both GHL and GoCardless details side-by-side — choose Yes to proceed, No to search manually, or Cancel
- **Single payment support**: GoCardless DD payments with only 1 payment now use a one-off `create_payment` instead of an instalment schedule with count=1

### Fixes (v3.0.4)

- **Name-fallback field trimming**: Pipe-delimited fields from the name-fallback CLI output are now trimmed — fixes empty/corrupted command arguments caused by trailing whitespace

### SideKick_GC v1.2.1

- **Single payment via `create_payment`**: Silent mode with 1 payline creates a one-off payment instead of an instalment schedule
- **`--check-mandate-by-name` output**: Includes customer name and email in the response for the name-fallback confirmation dialog

---

## v3.0.3 (2026-03-09)

### New Features (v3.0.3)

- **Email PDF toolbar button**: New toolbar button emails invoice PDF to client via GHL email template
- **Email PDF settings**: GHL email template selector in Print tab + toggle in Toolbar settings tab
- **Email PDF print-then-email flow**: Follows the same Print-to-PDF procedure (print → save → copy) then emails the generated PDF automatically

### Fixes (v3.0.3)

- **Email PDF template persistence**: Opening/closing Settings no longer wipes the saved PDF email template when the template cache is empty
- **Toolbar settings show/hide**: Email PDF toggle now properly hidden/shown when switching settings tabs

---

## v3.0.2 (2026-03-09)

### New Features (v3.0.2)

- **Silent GoCardless plan creation**: When all payment data is available (mandate + paylines from album), creates the GoCardless instalment schedule silently via CLI — no GUI window opened
- **Auto-detect silent mode**: `GC_ShowPayPlanDialog` reads payment data from the .psa file when PayPlanLine globals are empty (toolbar/search flow), and goes silent when mandate ID and DD paylines are both available
- **GoCardless plan cancellation on Replace**: Cancels active instalment schedules, subscriptions, and pending one-off payments on the mandate before creating a new plan
- **Replace PayPlan button**: Mandate dialogs show "Replace PayPlan" when existing plans are detected, "Add PayPlan" when none

### Fixes (v3.0.2)

- **PayPlan .psa injection newline bug**: JSON amount parser now stops at `\n`/`\r` and trims whitespace — fixes broken `write_psa_payments` args from pretty-printed result JSON
- **Pending deposit not cancelled**: `cancel_mandate_plans` now cancels pending one-off payments (deposits) alongside instalment schedules and subscriptions

### SideKick_GC v1.2.0

- **`--silent` CLI flag**: Create payment plans headlessly — requires `--mandate-id`, `--paylines`, `--plan-name`; writes result file and exits without GUI
- **`--cancel-plans` CLI command**: Cancel all active plans on a mandate (subscriptions, instalments, and pending one-off payments)
- **`cancel_mandate_plans()` API**: Iterates all plans on a mandate and cancels active ones
- **`cancel_payment()` API**: Cancel individual pending payments

---

## v3.0.1 (2026-03-09)

### New Features (v3.0.1)

- **Multi-client PayPlan group detection**: Automatically targets the correct client in multi-group ProSelect albums by matching the PayPlan balance against each group's order total
- **Ambiguous balance prompt**: When multiple groups share the same balance, a dialog lets the user pick the correct client by name
- **Existing PayPlan detection**: Checks for existing payments before writing — offers Replace (delete old + write new), Add (append), or Cancel
- **PayPlan success dialog**: Shows payment count on success, confirms old plan removal when Replace was used

### Fixes (v3.0.1)

- **Toolbar multi-monitor positioning**: Toolbar now tracks the last active ProSelect window instead of picking the largest — fixes wrong-monitor placement when multiple PS windows exist
- **Toolbar dialog hiding**: Toolbar hides when ProSelect dialogs (Client Setup, Print, etc.) are the active window
- **Toolbar drag persistence**: Deferred toolbar rebuild after drag prevents AHK v1 g-label thread blocking on subsequent drags
- **Toolbar background sampling**: Uses tracked ProSelect window for correct screen color sampling on multi-monitor setups

### Improvements (v3.0.1)

- **GoCardless prompt removed**: PayPlan flow now shows a success dialog instead of auto-launching SideKick_GC
- **write_psa_payments --clear**: Scoped to target group only in multi-client albums
- **read_psa_payments --group N**: Read payments from a specific client group

---

## v3.0.0 (2026-03-05)

### SideKick_GC v1.1.1 — Unified with SideKick_PS

SideKick_GC is now included in the SideKick_PS package. GC can still run as an independent
standalone application, but from this version onward all GC changes are also tracked here.

#### New Features

- **Close to Tray option**: "Close to system tray" checkbox in GC Settings — when enabled, X hides to system tray; when disabled (default), X minimises to taskbar
- **Toast on Mandate Cancellation**: "Show Windows notification on mandate cancellation" checkbox — displays a Windows toast when polling detects bank-cancelled mandates (enabled by default)
- **Exit Program button**: Red "⏻ Exit" button in GC Settings to fully quit the application, with a confirmation warning if notification polling is active
- **Polling-active exit warning**: Exiting via Settings or tray menu warns if polling is running — reminds that SideKick needs to stay in the background for polling to work

#### Improvements

- **X button behaviour**: Clicking X now minimises to taskbar (or hides to tray if enabled) — the app always stays running
- **Desktop Shortcut button**: Renamed with the SideKick_GC app icon instead of emoji
- **Smaller checkboxes & radio buttons**: Reduced indicator size and font for a cleaner, more compact look
- **Settings layout**: Bottom-justified Desktop Shortcut and Exit buttons on the same row with matching height

---

## v2.5.52 (2026-03-04)

### New Features (v2.5.52)

- **Cardly Receiving Date**: Schedule card arrival for a specific date — dropdown with ASAP (default), Birthday, Shoot Anniversary, and any date-type GHL custom fields. Cardly calculates dispatch backward from the requested arrival date.
- **Cardly no-album mode**: Launch Cardly without a ProSelect album open — skips album-dependent steps and shows a folder picker to select images manually. Requires a GHL client to be loaded first.
- **Receiving Date refresh button**: Fetches all date-type custom fields from the GHL contact record and adds them to the dropdown.
- **Birthday always visible**: Birthday entry always appears in the Receiving Date dropdown — shows the date from GHL or "Unknown" if not on file.
- **Shoot Anniversary**: Session date fields auto-calculate +1 year for the anniversary.

### Improvements (v2.5.52)

- **Wedding → WD**: Wedding abbreviated to WD in date labels for compact dropdown display.
- **Dropdown scroll**: Receiving Date dropdown limited to 6 visible rows with scrollbar for longer lists.

### Bug Fixes (v2.5.52)

- **Loader animation freeze**: Added `SetWinDelay, -1` to CardlyLoader — AHK's default 100ms delay on every `WinExist()` call was blocking the animation thread.
- **Loader timer collision**: Merged two separate timers (AnimateBar + CheckDone) into a single `Tick` timer with `Critical` flag — exit checks run every 6th tick to keep bar smooth.
- **Loader border & encoding**: Added 1px border to loading GUI, removed emoji from title text, saved with UTF-8 BOM for AHK v1 compatibility.

## v2.5.51 (2026-03-04)

### Bug Fixes (v2.5.51)

- **GoCardless RunCmdToFile migration**: All 6 `RunCaptureOutput` callers (mandate check, connection test, wizard test, billing request, create payment, list plans) switched to proven `RunCmdToFile` — eliminates the `RunCaptureOutput ERROR: 1` exception that caused empty output.
- **Cardly preview unified CLI**: Cardly button used `GetScriptPath` which returned the old individual `_cpg.exe` (missing in unified build). Now uses `GetScriptCommand` which routes through `SideKick_PS_CLI.exe cardly-preview`.
- **Write PSA payments unified CLI**: Payment Calculator used `GetScriptPath` + manual `cmd /c` for `write_psa_payments`. Now uses `GetScriptCommand` + `RunCmdToFile`.
- **DevUpdateVersion writes to source**: "Update Version" button was writing `version.json` to the install folder (`Program Files`) instead of the source repo (`C:\Stash`). Same fix applied to QuickPush's `SideKick_PS.ahk` and `version.json` updates.
- **Build --clean removed**: PyInstaller `--clean` flag caused a confirmation prompt that blocked automated builds waiting for keypress. Removed from both unified CLI and individual exe builds.

### New Features (v2.5.51)

- **Cardly loading GUI**: Animated dark-themed progress bar appears immediately on Cardly button press, with status updates at each preparation step (checking ProSelect, reading images, fetching client, loading message, finding exports, building preview, launching). Stays visible with pulsing animation until the PySide6 preview window appears.

### Improvements (v2.5.51)

- **No console flash**: Cardly preview exe launched with `Hide` flag and async polling instead of `RunWait` — eliminates the 2-second console window flash.
- **Seamless loading**: Single continuous loading experience from button press to preview window, replacing the old sequence of brief tooltip → console flash → frozen startup.

---

## v2.5.47 (2026-03-04)

### Bug Fixes (v2.5.47)

- **RunCaptureOutput rewritten**: Used temp `.cmd` file approach instead of `WScript.Shell.Exec(ComSpec /c ...)` — fixes empty stdout when the exe path contains spaces (e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\...`). Affected all GoCardless mandate checks, connection tests, and other `RunCaptureOutput` callers.
- **Helper detection for unified build**: Startup helper version check now looks for `SideKick_PS_CLI.exe` when individual `_sps.exe` is absent, eliminating the `WARNING: sync_ps_invoice helper not found!` log entry.
- **Update/resync error display**: Error dialog now shows client name, shoot number, email, album, and order total when an update or resync fails (was previously blank).
- **Invoice update draft pre-check**: When new total < amount already paid, attempts `update_invoice_to_draft()` first to bypass GHL payment restrictions. Error message now includes actual amounts.

### Improvements (v2.5.47)

- **Unified build priority**: Build script now compiles unified CLI exe first; if successful, skips all 13 individual Python exes (faster builds, smaller installer).
- **Validation error guidance**: Error dialog shows specific fix instructions when "total may be less than amount paid" — suggests Replace, refund in GHL, or re-export.

---

## v2.5.46 (2026-03-04)

### New Features (v2.5.46)

- **Invoice Update**: Update an existing GHL invoice's line items and amounts in place via `--update-invoice <id>`. Preserves recorded payments, records any new past payments not yet in GHL, and replaces future recurring schedules.
- **Invoice Resync**: Delete old invoice(s) for a shoot and create a fresh one in a single `--resync` operation. Aborts safely if provider payments (GoCardless/Stripe) need manual refund.
- **Payment-Aware Duplicate Prompt**: When a duplicate invoice is detected, a `DarkMsgBox` with four buttons replaces the old Yes/No MsgBox:
  - **Replace** — delete old invoice and resync (default when no payments)
  - **Update** — update items in place (default when payments exist)
  - **New** — create another invoice alongside existing
  - **Cancel** — do nothing
- **Shoot-Scoped Deletion**: New `delete_shoot_invoices()` function targets only invoices matching the shoot number, not all client invoices

### Improvements (v2.5.46)

- **Duplicate Check `amount_paid`**: `check_existing_invoice()` now returns `amount_paid` so AHK can show payment status and choose the right default action
- **Update Payment Diffing**: Compares XML past payment total vs GHL `amountPaid` and only records the difference — no duplicate payment records
- **Update Schedule Replacement**: Cancels existing recurring schedules matching the shoot, then creates new ones for remaining future payments (with rounding-in-deposit support)

---

## v2.5.45 (2026-03-04)

### Bug Fixes (v2.5.45)

- **Stale Mandates 'script not found'**: Fixed `gocardless_api script not found` error when Stale Mandates GUI is launched via the unified `SideKick_PS_CLI.exe`. The individual `_gca.exe` no longer ships — `_find_gc_script()` now discovers `SideKick_PS_CLI.exe` and routes GoCardless API calls through the `gocardless` subcommand automatically. Legacy standalone exe/py fallback preserved for backwards compatibility and dev mode.

---

## v2.5.44 (2026-03-04)

### New Features (v2.5.44)

- **SideKick_GC Payments Tab**: New "Payments" tab in SideKick_GC for creating single payments and recurring subscriptions — mirrors GoCardless dashboard functionality
- **Single Payments via GC**: Create one-off payments against an active mandate with amount, charge date, description, reference, and metadata
- **Subscriptions via GC**: Create recurring subscriptions with configurable frequency (weekly/monthly/yearly), interval, day-of-month, and end condition (indefinite / fixed count / end date)
- **Inline Name Prefix**: Plan name and subscription name inputs now show the Statement Label prefix inline as a non-editable label — user sees the full bank statement name but can only edit the suffix

### Improvements (v2.5.44)

- **SideKick_GC v1.1.0**: Subscription API (`create_subscription`, `cancel_subscription`), new worker threads, mandate ID forwarding to Payments tab
- **Python Package v1.1.0**: `sidekick_ps` package version bumped to 1.1.0

---

## v2.5.43 (2026-03-02)

### New Features (v2.5.43)

- **Stale Mandates Qt6 GUI**: New standalone PySide6 dark-themed window for finding and cancelling expired GoCardless mandates. Sortable table with checkboxes, last payment date, total collected, customer name, email, and mandate ID. Batch cancel with two-stage safety warnings (irreversible). Singleton — prevents duplicate windows.
- **Stale Mandates Button**: New button in GoCardless settings panel launches the Qt6 GUI
- **Toolbar Auto-Scale**: New checkbox in Toolbar settings auto-links toolbar size to ProSelect window width using `psW / (1920 × DPI_Scale)` with 5% quantization and 800ms cooldown
- **Toolbar Manual Scale**: New dropdown (50%–100%) for manually sizing the toolbar on smaller screens

### Improvements (v2.5.43)

- **cmd.exe Robustness**: `RunCmdToFile()` and `RunCmdToFileAsync()` helpers replace all 17+ vulnerable `%ComSpec% /c` call sites with temp `.cmd` file pattern — safe with spaces and quotes in paths
- **Build Pipeline**: PySide6 auto-installed at build time; `stale_mandates_gui` compiled to `_smg.exe` with `--noconsole`, code-signed, and included in Inno Setup installer

### Bug Fixes (v2.5.43)

- **GoCardless 'No Plans' Hang**: Fixed cmd.exe quoting issue with paths containing spaces causing the button to hang indefinitely

---

## v2.5.41 (2026-02-28)

### Bug Fixes (v2.5.41)

- **GoCardless Button No Output**: All CLI Python helper EXEs (`_gca.exe`, `_sps.exe`, `_fgc.exe`, `_ugc.exe`, etc.) were compiled with PyInstaller `--noconsole`, which disconnects stdout. On systems where AHK runs the EXE via `RunWait ... Hide` with no console allocated, `print()` output was silently discarded — causing the GoCardless button to always return "script returned no output". Fixed by compiling CLI scripts with `--console` instead. GUI scripts (`cardly_preview_gui`) remain `--noconsole`.
- **Build Script Console Flag**: `build_and_archive.ps1` now uses a `$guiScripts` list to apply `--noconsole` only to GUI scripts. All other scripts get `--console` so stdout piping works reliably.

---

## v2.5.40 (2026-02-28)

### New Features (v2.5.40)

- **Review Order Toolbar Button**: New button opens ProSelect Orders > Review Order via `Alt+O` menu keystrokes. Uses Receipt font glyph (U+E762) — no PNG, same icon system as all other buttons.
- **Review Order Settings Toggle**: Clickable icon in Toolbar settings tab (amber background) with INI persistence (`ShowBtn_ReviewOrder`)
- **EXE Code Signing**: All compiled `.exe` files in the Release folder (SideKick_PS.exe + all Python helpers) are now digitally signed before the installer is built
- **RFC 3161 Timestamping**: Signatures use SHA-256 with RFC 3161 timestamp — remains valid after certificate expiry
- **Timestamp Failover**: Tries 3 timestamp servers in sequence (Certum → DigiCert → Sectigo) for reliability
- **Cardly Browse Image Button**: New browse button (📂) in card preview crop controls — select any image from disc, adds to filmstrip and displays it. Opens at the album folder by default.
- **GoCardless Diagnostics**: New `gc_diagnose.bat` and `gc_fix_connection.bat` tools for troubleshooting GoCardless connectivity issues

### Improvements (v2.5.40)

- **Toolbar Button Position**: Review Order sits to the left of Camera in toolbar and settings tab
- **Settings GroupBox**: Enlarged to accommodate the additional Review Order row
- **Settings Hotkey Default**: Default Settings hotkey changed from `Ctrl+Shift+W` to `Ctrl+Shift+I` to avoid conflicts
- **Hotkey Passthrough**: When ProSelect/SideKick is not the active window, hotkeys are now passed through to the target application instead of being silently consumed
- **Cardly Rotate Button Sizing**: Orientation swap button now uses pixel-based sizing (32×32) for consistent appearance across systems
- **PII Redaction in Logs**: All `debug_log()` and `error_log()` calls now pass data through `_redact_pii()` before writing — emails, names, addresses, and phone numbers are automatically masked. Prevents personal data leaking into Gist-uploaded debug logs.
- **PII Redaction in Console Output**: Status `print()` messages no longer include client emails, names, or addresses — replaced with `[redacted]` or generic descriptions

---

## v2.5.39 (2026-02-27)

### New Features (v2.5.39)

- **File Browser Dropdown**: Replaced Editor Path text field with auto-detecting dropdown — automatically finds installed Adobe Bridge, Lightroom Classic, Photoshop, and Capture One. Browse button for manual selection.
- **Dynamic Toolbar Icons**: Open Folder toolbar button now shows the selected file browser's icon (Bridge, Lightroom, or Explorer) recolored to match the toolbar icon colour

### Improvements (v2.5.39)

- **Toolbar Icon Recoloring**: File browser icons use the same white-source → PowerShell recolor pipeline as Photoshop/GC/Cardly icons, updating automatically on toolbar colour change

### Bug Fixes (v2.5.39)

- **Cardly Orientation Swap API**: Fixed `create_cardly_artwork` using the wrong template ID after flipping between landscape/portrait — `template_id` was passed as `name` parameter instead of `media_id_override`, causing dimension mismatch errors
- **Open Folder Button Visibility**: Fixed Open Folder toolbar icon/label not hiding when switching away from Toolbar settings tab

---

## v2.5.38 (2026-02-27)

### New Features (v2.5.38)

- **Toolbar Section Separators**: Visual dividers between GHL, Shortcuts, and Services button groups on the floating toolbar — clearer button organisation at a glance
- **GoCardless Auto-Detect on Payment Entry**: After writing DD payments to an album, SideKick detects GoCardless/Direct Debit payment types and offers to create them in GoCardless immediately
- **Settings Export/Import: Sticker Support**: Cardly sticker overlay PNGs are now base64-encoded into the `.skp` export package and restored on import — stickers transfer seamlessly between machines

### Improvements (v2.5.38)

- **Toolbar Button Order**: Refresh button moved before Sort; buttons logically grouped into GHL → Shortcuts → Services sections
- **PayPlan Window Detection Simplified**: Payline watcher no longer requires the "Add Payment" list window — only the payline entry form ("Date" text) is needed, fixing detection on some ProSelect versions
- **PayPlan Silent Success**: Removed confirmation dialog after successful payment entry — success indicated by sound only, failures still show error dialog
- **Settings Export/Import Summary**: Confirmation dialogs now list toolbar button visibility, Cardly sticker overlays, and GoCardless settings in the package contents
- **Code Signing**: Installer and uninstaller are now digitally signed with Certum code signing certificate (Zoom Studios Ltd)

### Bug Fixes (v2.5.38)

- **PayPlan EnteringPaylines State**: Fixed `EnteringPaylines` flag not being reset after payment write — previously could block subsequent payment entries until script restart

---

## v2.5.37 (2026-02-27)

### New Features (v2.5.37)

- **Open Folder Toolbar Button**: New toolbar button opens the album's image source folder (where the original photos reside on disk) rather than the .psa file location
- **GetAlbumSourceFolder()**: Uses PSConsole `getImageData` to extract the actual `shellpath` from the first image element — no Python or SQLite needed

---

## v2.5.36 (2026-02-26)

### New Features (v2.5.36)

- **Cardly Template Orientation Swap**: Rotate button (⇄) in the card preview GUI switches crop between Landscape and Portrait, automatically using the matched template pair
- **Cardly Orientation Pair Detection**: RefreshCardlyTemplates auto-discovers L↔P template pairs by stripping orientation suffixes and performing case-insensitive base name matching
- **Lead Connector QR Toggle**: New checkbox in GHL settings switches QR code URL between white-label domain (opens browser) and `app.leadconnector.app` (opens LC mobile app)
- **Cardly Sign Up Button**: Added "Sign Up" button in Cardly settings next to Dashboard
- **Cardly Dashboard URL Configurable**: Dashboard URL now editable in Settings instead of hardcoded
- **Direct PSA Payment Writing**: New `write_psa_payments.py` script injects payments directly into .psa SQLite files
- **UpdatePS Payment Flow**: Save album → write payments to PSA → reload album (no XML export needed)

### Improvements (v2.5.36)

- **Cardly Sticker: Open Folder**: Added "Open Folder..." option to the sticker overlay dropdown — opens the sticker folder in Explorer for quick access to add/remove sticker PNGs
- **Cardly Orientation Pair: API ID Fallback**: Orientation swap now also matches template pairs by Cardly API ID (e.g. `thankyou-photocard-l` ↔ `thankyou-photocard-p`) when display name matching fails
- **GoCardless Always Live**: Removed environment selector from settings and setup wizard (was Sandbox/Live dropdown). Environment is now always "live" — simplifies setup and prevents accidental sandbox usage
- **GoCardless Wizard Simplified**: Reduced setup wizard from 5 steps to 4 by removing the environment selection step
- **Plan Naming: Order Date**: Added "Order Date" field option to GoCardless plan naming dropdown — reads the order date from the .psa album file
- **Plan Naming Format Applied**: Plan naming format from Settings is now used to auto-generate the default plan name in the payment dialog (previously just used the album name)
- **PSConsole saveAlbum**: Replaces Ctrl+S keyboard automation with direct API call (no blind 3-second sleep)
- **PSConsole openAlbum**: Replaces Ctrl+O with direct API call and smart single-PSA file detection
- **Cardly Message Box Height**: Doubled from 4 to 8 lines for longer personalised messages
- **Cardly Multiline Messages**: Full `\n` escape chain across INI → AHK → command line → Python preserves line breaks
- **Cardly Spinner Animation**: Replaced stalling ttk.Progressbar with canvas-based spinning dots animation
- **Card Details Orientation Label**: Size display now shows "Landscape" or "Portrait" next to dimensions
- **GoCardless Crash Handler**: Added top-level exception handler to gocardless_api.py — unhandled errors now print `ERROR|...` to stdout instead of producing silent empty output
- **GoCardless Empty Output Detection**: Test connection and mandate check now detect when the script returns no output and display a specific message about antivirus/exe blocking (previously showed blank error)

### Bug Fixes (v2.5.36)

- **Cardly Address Validation**: State/county field no longer required (UK addresses don't have state)

## v2.5.35 (2026-02-25)

### Bug Fixes (v2.5.35)

- **GHL Photo Link URL Mismatch**: Fixed contact Photo Link custom field storing the internal Google Storage URL instead of the public CDN URL (`assets.cdn.filesafe.space`). Upload response URL is now normalised to the correct public domain.
- **GoCardless API Token Rejected on Re-entry**: Fixed `Base64_Encode()` using `CRYPT_STRING_BASE64` flag which embeds `\r\n` every 76 characters — this broke the JSON credentials file when encoding long tokens (e.g., GoCardless live tokens). Now uses `CRYPT_STRING_NOCRLF` flag to produce single-line base64. Also added `Trim()` to the Edit Token input to strip accidental whitespace from pasted tokens.
